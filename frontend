Language Selection: Allow users to choose the language they want to learn.

Exercise Interface: Create a clean and interactive interface for exercises. Provide clear instructions and feedback to users.

User Profile: Design and implement a user profile page where users can view their progress and update preferences.
Leaderboard: Create a leaderboard section that displays top-performing users, possibly categorized by the language they are learning.
